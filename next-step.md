Steps of Front end development:

1- Micro front end (Deep search) 1/2 weeks
2- Using Ui libraries with UI modifications and Handle UI issues (Current UI of demo)  1 month
4- Start Integration with BE (In case of Ready backend "85-100%") -> 6/8 weeks
5- Testing (Internal stage -> Starting from UI complete with no huge modifications) -> 4-6 weeks

Known that: some UI modifications expected to be implemented during integration with BE and testing.


Total expected time: 4-5 months for stable version.
